# Foundit

Lost an item? No need to post it on the main Cornell Snapchat story, post it here! Whether you found something you want to return or want help finding something you lost, Foundit is the app for you.

Frontend of the project: https://github.com/tanyaaravind/FoundIt

Foundit is meant to fix a common problem on Cornell campus, lost items. Everyone has had a time where they lost and item or found someone else's lost item and not known what to do. Our app gives students
a place to look and post if they've lost sopmething, or post if theyve found another person's missing item. Foundit contains two pages - one for items people have lost, and one for found items. 
You can post an item to either page with an image of the item and a description. It also has a search feature which lets you search for items. 

Backend requirements:

Routes: We have 10 routes, including 4 GET, 1 DELETE, and 5 POST.

Tables: We have 3 tables in our database - one for images, one for users, and one for posts.

We have included an API specification explaining each implemented endpoint.
